# MySQLEmployeeTracker

In this homework, we were assigned to use MySQL along with working in VS to create an Employee Tracker System that can be accessed, viewed, and changed via the terminal in VS code. 

The data basaes were built in MySQL, then linked to VS Code to bring in the data.

Upon running the node app.js command, the user will be presented with a series of possible actions. 

The actions are as follow:

-View Employees 
-Add an Employee
-Update an Employee's Role
-View Department
-Add a Department
-View Roles
-Add a role

After adding an employee, view the employees list and see the new addition.

After adding a department, view the department list and see the new addition.

After adding a new role, view the roles list and see the new addition.

Use the update an employee's role action to change what the employee does for work. 

This employee tracker will allow organized, clear, cohesive workplace management. 

Enjoy!
